Code conventions:

Pacal casing (one CAPITAL letter) for:
- Functions
- Classes

Camel casing for:
- parameters
- properties (languague feature) (get; set)

Example
Private int someInt

Public int SomeInt
{
Get: protected set;
}

Brackets{}
On next lines
Parameters met _
Example:
Private void Methodname(bool _Param)
{

}

Booleans with is and can
Example: canWalk, Ismoving

Coding comments are in english

Code ordering:

Using statements
Variable first than methods
Variable order:
Public 
Protected
Private

Function ordering
Unity handles (update,start,awake)
Public
Protected
Private

Every function needs a private protected and public (no void without accses modifier!)
Even start and loopâ€¦.

Multiple classes in 1 one file is allowed
But defining the class should be in the main class of the script
Alternatively use a struct.

Tips and tricks
- Goto/jumps are functions that go to other locations of code.
- Setting properties to a protected protects the value from being set from else were.
